                        harness until now. I am decided because I know that this is the life for me and I am willing to make it happen.</span>

                            what the job was as long as I knew that I'm able to make money only because I'm helping the business make money. Knowing this has 
                            greatly improved my perspective of how we can work together to make more money together.

                            From welding up a new project to 3D printing a new prototype, figuring things out has given me success in everything that I put my mind to.

                                designs that I can fabricate, original designs to built with the 3D printer and updated software that I can write. Creativeness is something that I was definintely
                                born with. Finding new ideas that are born right inside my own mind is a passion of mine that I will never lose.

                                This is so because in order to be successful there it takes weeks of hard work tightly collaborated in every case. If focus is lost, the case is as well. When I returned
                                I could easily get to work on multiple projects of completely different styles at the same time and be successfulin all.

                                who I am. I became fluent in Spanish in just 6 months. I became sufficient in welding in just over 8. There are many other skills that I have developed 
                                like sowing, web design and snowboarding that I have managed to master because of my focus, creativity and problem-solving character.
