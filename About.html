                                born with. Finding new ideas that are born right inside my own mind is a passion of mine that I will never lose.

                                This is so because in order to be successful there it takes weeks of hard work tightly collaborated in every case. If focus is lost, the case is as well. When I returned
                                I could easily get to work on multiple projects of completely different styles at the same time and be successfulin all.

                    Since he's retired from the Bureau, he has retained much of his training in the art of detecting lies and helping regular people free themselves from 
                    the lies of others, sadly, loved ones. He had reached out previosuly to a company to help him get out there to start helping people around Utah by creating a web site. 
                    The web site had served him well, but I knew that I could do much better than them and felt obligated to help him. Eager for any experience that I could get in web development 
                    I took to the task of building my Grandfather a new, trustworthy, aesthetic and modern web presence.

                    wanted more. The class was good, but I was better. It was then that I found codecademy. I first took their free javascript course that got me hooked! From then on I kept 
                    taking more courses and even purchased the pro subscription to keep feeding my wanting to learn brain. The following are my achievements there.

                    No template or external wordpress was used. I made it like this partly so I could experiment with my capabilities, but also to display what I can do on my own. I am proud of it, but I can keep going.
